# fully-connected-neural-network-for-1D-functions
This is a class project for CS435. We are implementing a full data, model, and pipeline in Pytorch, resulting in a fully connected neural network that will visualize a 1D function. Model's loss was calculated using pytorch's built in mean squared error function and its parameters were optimized using pytorch Adam optimizer.
